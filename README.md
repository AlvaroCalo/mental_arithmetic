1<br />
Calculate: 92 * 8<br />

Possible operations: +, -, *, / <br />

To select the number of digits of the operation you have to type as many 1 as digits you want to have the operation, for example, if you want an operation like 45 + 9:<br />

How many digits has to have the first term?<br />
11<br />
How many digits has to have the second term?<br />
1<br />

You can use instead of 1 any other digit excep 0, for example:<br />

12<br />
How many digits has to have the second term?<br />
1<br />

The answer of divisions has to be given like this:<br />

465/8 = 58 1/8<br />
75/5 = 15 0/5<br />
